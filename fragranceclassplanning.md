- we should ideally store the perfumes that we own in a class, store it as a type in mongo?
- fields necessary?
    1. brand
    2. name
    3. unparsed name
    4. perfumania website link
    5. notes (dont know how to store tbh, we could use enums to store the type of note it is- top, middle, base)
    6.
